=head1 NAME

Net::SSH::Mechanize::Multi - parallel ssh invocation 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $manager = Net::SSH::Mechanize::Multi->new(

        # Set the default parameters for the Net::SSH::Mechanize
        # instances we will create
        constructor_defaults => { login_timeout => 180 },

    );

    # Add connection definitions as a list of connection-name to
    # Net::SSH::Mechanize instance pairs (or shorthand equivalents, as
    # illustrated).
    $manager->add(

        # This defines the connection using a
        # Net::SSH::Mechanize::ConnectParams instance (or subclass
        # thereof)
        connection1 => Net::SSH::Mechanize::ConnectParams->new(
            hostname => 'host1.com',
        ),

        # This defines it using a hashref of constructor parameters
        # for Net::SSH::Mechanize
        connection2 => {
            user => 'joe',
            hostname => 'host1.com',
            login_timeout => 60,
        },
        
        # This passes a Net::SSH::Mechanize instance directly
        connection3 => Net::SSH::Mechanize->new(
            user => 'joe',
            hostname => 'host2.com',
            login_timeout => 60,
        ),

        # ...        
    );

    # At this point no hosts have been contacted.

    # Connect to a named subset of them all in parallel like this.
    # The callback should expect the name and the appropriate
    # Net::SSH::Mechanize instance as arguments.
    # Synchronous commands in the callback work asyncronously 
    # thanks to Coro::AnyEvent.
    my @names = qw(host1 host2);
    my $threads = $manager->in_parallel(@names => sub {
        my ($name, $ssh) = @_;

        printf "About to connect to %s using;\n'$s'\n\n",
            $name, $ssh->connection_params->ssh_cmd

        # note, the login is done implicitly when you access the
        # ->session parameter, or a method which delegates to it.

        # do stuff... 
        print "checking git status of config definition:\n";
        print $ssh->sudo_capture("cd /root/config; git status");
        
        # ...
    });

    # Wait for them all to complete.
    $_->join for @$threads;

    print "done\n";


There is a full implementation of this kind of usage is in the
C<gofer> script included in this distribution.

=head1  CLASS METHODS

=head2 C<< $obj = $class->new(%params) >>

Creates a new instance.  Parameters is a hash or a list of key-value
parameters.  Valid parameter keys are:

=over 4

=item C<constructor_defaults>

This is an optional parameter which can be used to define a hashref of
default parameters to pass to C<Net::SSH::Mechanize> instances created
by this class.  These defaults can be overridden in individual cases.

=back 

Currently it is also possible to pass parameters to initialise the
C<names> and C<ssh_instances> attributes, but since the content of
those are intended to be correlated this is definitely not
recommended.  Use C<< ->add >> instead.

=head1 INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<< $hashref = $obj->constructor_defaults >>
=head2 C<< $obj->constructor_defaults(\%hashref) >>

This is an read-write accessor which allows you to specify the default
parameters to pass to the C<Net::SSH::Mechanize> constructor. These
defaults can be overridden in individual cases.

=head2 C<< $hashref = $obj->names >>

This is a hashref of connection names mapped to C<Net::SSH::Mechanize>
instances.  It is not recommend you change this directly, use the 
C<< ->add >> method instead.

=head2 C<< $hashref = $obj->ssh_instances >>

This is an arrayref listing C<Net::SSH::Mechanize> instances we have
created, in the order they have been defined via C<< ->add >> (which
is also the order they will be iterated over within C<< ->in_parallel >>).

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 C<< @mech_instances = $obj->add(%connections) >>

Adds one or more named connection definitions.

C<%connections> is a hash or list of name-value pairs defining what to
connect to. The order in which they are defined here is preserved and
used when iterating over them in C<< ->in_parallel >>.

The names are simple string aliases, and can be anything unique (to
this instance).  If a duplicate is encountered, an exception will be
thrown.

The values can be: 

=over 4

=item B<<A C<Net::SSH::Mechanize> instance>>

The instance will be used as given to connect to a host.

=item B<<A C<Net::SSH::Mechanize::ConnectParams>> instance>>

The instance will be used to create a C<Net::SSH::Mechanize> instance to use.

=item B<A hashref of constructor paramters for C<Net::SSH::Mechanize> >>

The hashref will be passed to C<< Net::SSH::Mechanize->new >> to get an instance to use.

=back

A list of the C<Net::SSH::Mechanize> instances are returned, in the
order they were defined.

This method can be called any number of times, so long as the
connection names are never duplicated.


=head2 C<< @threads = $obj->in_parallel(@names, \&actions) >>

This method accepts a list of host-names, and a callback.  The callback
should expect two parameters: a connection name, and a
C<Net::SSH::Mechanize> instance.

It first checks that all the names have been defined in an earlier 
C<< ->add >> invocation.  If any are unknown, an exception is thrown.

Otherwise, it iterates over the names in the order given, and invokes
the callback with the name and the appropriate C<Net::SSH::Mechanize>
instance.

Note: the callback is invoked each time as a I<co-routine>. See
L<Coro> and L<Coro::AnyEvent> for more information about this, but it
essentially means that each one is asynchronously run in parallel.
This method returns a list of C<Coro> threads, immediately, before the
callbacks have completed.

Your program is then free to do other things, and/or call C<< ->join >>
on each of the threads to wait for their termination.
