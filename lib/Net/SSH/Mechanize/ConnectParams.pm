=head1 NAME

Net::SSH::Mechanize::ConnectParams - encapsulates information about an ssh connection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This class is just a container for log-in details with a method which
constructs an approprate C<ssh> command invocation.

This equates to C</usr/bin/ssh -t somewhere.com sh>:

    my $minimal_params = Net::SSH::Mechanize::ConnectParams->new(
        host => 'somewhere.com',
    );

This equates to C</usr/bin/ssh -l someone -p 999 -t somewhere.com sh>:

    my $all_params = Net::SSH::Mechanize::ConnectParams->new(
        host => 'somewhere.com',
        user => 'someone',
        port => 999,
        password => 'secret',
    );

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 C<< $obj = $class->new(%parameters) >>

Creates a new instance.  Parameters is a hash or a list of key-value
parameters.  Valid parameter keys are:

=over 4

=item C<host>

The hostname to connect to (a scalar string).  Either this or C<connection_params> must
be supplied.

=item C<user>

The name of the user account to log into (a scalar string).  If not
given, no user will be supplied to C<ssh> (this typically means it
will use the current user as default).

=item C<port>

The port to connect to (a positive scalar integer; C<ssh> will default
to 22 if this is not specificed).

=item C<password>

The password to connect with (a scalar string).  This is only required
if authentication will be performed, either on log-in or when sudoing.

=head1 INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<< $obj->host >>
=head2 C<< $obj->user >>
=head2 C<< $obj->password >>
=head2 C<< $obj->port >>

These are all read-write accessors for the attribute parameters
accepted by the constructor.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 C<< $cmd = $obj->ssh_cmd >>

This constructs the C<ssh> command to invoke.  If you need something
different, you can create a subclass which overrides this method, and
pass that via the C<connection_params> parameter to
C<< Net::SSH::Mechanize->new() >>.
